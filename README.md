Python Examples for MSI
=======================

The IPython notebooks in this repository accompany the Python for Scientific Computing workshop hosted by the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute. Visit https://www.msi.umn.edu/tutorials/python-scientific-computing for details and a PDF copy of the slides.

Getting started
---------------

You can clone a copy of this repository using git, for example:

    git clone https://github.com/mbmilligan/msi-ipython-nb-ex
    
If you have a web browser and are connected to the UMN network, you can access our JupyterHub server at: [notebooks.msi.umn.edu](https://notebooks.msi.umn.edu)

If you are at a command line at the MSI, the commands

    module load python
    cd msi-ipython-nb-ex
    ipython notebook

will start the Jupyter notebook system in your web browser. From there, you can open the saved IPython notebooks (files with the extension .ipynb) by clicking on them.

If you do not have access to a Python environment right now, you can click on the Binder badge above to run these examples through [Mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) in a temporary environment.
